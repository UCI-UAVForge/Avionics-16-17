Test programs should send a "hello" string in the form of bytes from Arduino Uno slave to Arduino Due master (i2c).

Due Master writer and Uno slave reader is not sending proper data for some reason (yet), only sends zeroes. Will look into it.
Connection is functional however as shown by the test programs.
